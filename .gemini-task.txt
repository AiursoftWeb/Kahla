Status: CRITICAL - MERGE CONFLICTS DETECTED.
Target branch 'master' has been merged into your current branch 'fix-issue-13', and it resulted in conflicts.

Your task:
1. Identify all files with merge conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>).
2. Resolve the conflicts by choosing the correct code or combining changes as appropriate.
3. Ensure the project still builds and all tests pass after resolution.
4. DO NOT make any unrelated changes. Focus ONLY on resolving the conflicts.
5. You MUST remove all conflict markers before finishing.

I have already triggered the merge for you, so you will see conflict markers in the affected files. Please fix them immediately.
